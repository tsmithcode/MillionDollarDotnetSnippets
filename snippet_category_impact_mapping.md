“What took a month → a week. A week → a day. A day → an hour. An hour → a click.”

⸻

🔁 Reflection & Type Handling

Instead of building custom classes or property mappers for each CAD model, you dynamically handle object creation, property access, and type mapping using MapProps, SetProp, and CreateByName. This eliminates entire boilerplate files and turns a month-long refactor into a one-click metadata-driven engine for part libraries, belt assemblies, or ERP importers.

⸻

⚡ LINQ + Collections

Looping over BOMs or belt specs? Forget nested for-loops. With GroupByKey, JoinLists, and SafeToDictionary, you collapse 100+ lines of business logic into 1-liners. This transforms CAD configuration and ERP data flattening from a week of testing into an hour of copy-paste coding.

⸻

🚀 JSON & Dictionary

When feeding CAD data to web forms, APIs, or templates, you often serialize/deserialize repeatedly. ToJson, FromJson, and ToDictionary enable instant format conversions. Now, converting data between SugarCRM, Epicor, and your CAD tools is a matter of minutes—not days.

⸻

🧱 Dependency Injection Patterns

Your tools scale when they’re modular. RegisterAll<T>() auto-registers plugins, calculators, or validators by interface. Instead of manually wiring dependencies across Blazor, CLI, and backend apps, you build scalable app cores in an hour—not a week.

⸻

🧵 Async Pipelines & Retry

File processing, CAD automation, and ERP syncs are error-prone. With RetryAsync, FireAndForget, and WhenAll, you bulletproof async workflows. Tasks that crashed overnight now self-heal and scale—converting failed month-long batch jobs into always-on pipelines.

⸻

🧩 Minimal API

Forget bloated controllers. MapGet, MapPost, and EnableSwagger let you build versioned CAD file APIs, request routers, and drawing endpoints in literal minutes. What used to take a sprint becomes a one-day deliverable with full Swagger support.

⸻

🧠 Span & Memory

With FastSplit, RentBuffer, and ParseInt(ReadOnlySpan), you can parse belt files, model data, or serialized strings at 10x speed and zero allocation. A performance problem you’d normally profile for weeks? Fixed before lunch.

⸻

❌ Errors & Logging

TryWrap, LogJson, and ExceptionDetails make it effortless to trace, log, and recover from issues in CAD automation, plugin architecture, or dynamic runtime jobs. You no longer fear failures—they log themselves, isolate themselves, and guide your fixes.

⸻

🧬 Expression Trees

You can now dynamically filter belt records, order drawing sets, and generate property-access lambdas—all without reflection cost. BuildPredicate, CreateGetter, and OrderByProp empower your apps to evolve at runtime—no rebuilds required. A week of dev? Cut to an hour.

⸻

🧵 Source Generation Templates

Using GenerateCodeTemplate and InjectCode, you simulate real-time codegen for mapping, scaffolds, and data models. You’re no longer hand-coding converters or mappers—you’re generating them from config or metadata, which makes scaling to new product lines nearly instant.

⸻

🛠️ CLI Utilities

With WriteColor, DrawBox, and WriteBlock, you deliver internal tooling that looks pro and communicates clearly. Batch tools, CAD crawlers, and job queues become dev-friendly. What took a full UI sprint? Delivered in a weekend.

⸻

🔐 Secure Auth & Hashing

Need secure identifiers, password checks, or base64-encoded payloads? Sha256, SecureToken, and CheckPassword give you out-of-the-box security primitives. Building customer-safe, audit-proof pipelines becomes a morning task—not a backlog ticket.

⸻

📂 File & Stream

Parsing drawing files, configs, or templates? ReadLines, ReadStreamAsync, and WriteTextAsync give you rapid file access across .NET tools—CLI, API, desktop, or Blazor. You avoid the IO bottlenecks that stall entire builds.

⸻

📊 Parsing & Conversion

Sanitize incoming ERP strings, drawing request text, or CSV line entries with ParseIntSafe, ParseDecimalSafe, and ParseCsvLine. What used to be flaky input handling is now bulletproof—and done in 5 lines or less.

⸻

🧾 Enums & Attributes

With GetEnumDescription, HasAttribute<T>, and ParseEnum, you can build interfaces that adapt dynamically to user roles, drawing types, or product variants. No more updating hardcoded labels—your UI becomes reflection-driven and future-proof.

⸻

🧮 Data Validation

Auto-validate any request or drawing record with IsValid, MustBePresent, and TrimAllStrings. You ship high-confidence software with zero post-deployment field cleanup. The old month-long QA cycles? You replace them with runtime self-defense.

⸻

🌍 Config + Env

With GetEnv, LoadEnvFile, and CurrentEnv, you build apps that adjust on deployment—local, staging, or production. CAD plugins, microservices, and drawing tools respect environments with no rewrites, no redeploys, and no missed deadlines.

⸻

🧠 Meta + Caching

Memoize, SetCache, and InCache allow you to cache spec lookups, file parses, or expensive conversions. Instead of burning CPU reloading from disk or database, your logic hits RAM and returns instantly. Time = saved. Money = made.
