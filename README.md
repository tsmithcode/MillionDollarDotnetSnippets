## ⚡ What’s Inside?

This isn’t your typical utility dump.  
This is a handcrafted vault of reusable power moves:

- 🔁 Reflection & Type Tricks → `CreateByName`, `MapProps`, `SetProp`
- 🧠 LINQ Blackbelt Moves → `GroupByKey`, `ToLookupSafe`, `ZipToTuple`
- 🚀 Minimal API Scaffolds → `MapPost<TIn, TOut>()`, `FireAndForget()`
- 🧵 Async Retry & Resilience → `RetryAsync`, `WithTimeout`, `TryWrap()`
- 🧾 Enum + Metadata Extraction → `GetEnumDisplay`, `HasAttribute<T>()`
- 🔐 Secure Pipelines → `Sha256()`, `GenerateToken()`, `ValidatePassword()`
- 🧬 Expression Trees + Source Gen → `CreateGetter()`, `BuildPredicate()`
- 🌍 Environment-Ready Config → `LoadEnv()`, `CurrentEnv()`, `MustBePresent()`

Zero fluff. Every line earns its place.  
These are patterns I deploy to automate CAD systems, ERP workflows, and industrial-grade configurators in production.
