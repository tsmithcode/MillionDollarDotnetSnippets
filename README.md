⚡ What’s Inside?

This isn’t your typical utility dump. This is a handcrafted vault of reusable power moves:
	•	🔁 Reflection & Type Tricks → CreateByName, MapProps, SetProp
	•	🧠 LINQ Blackbelt Moves → GroupByKey, ToLookupSafe, ZipToTuple
	•	🚀 Minimal API Scaffolds → MapPost<TIn, TOut>(), FireAndForget()
	•	🧵 Async Retry & Resilience → RetryAsync, WithTimeout, TryWrap()
	•	🧾 Enum + Metadata Extraction → GetEnumDisplay, HasAttribute<T>()
	•	🔐 Secure Pipelines → Sha256(), GenerateToken(), ValidatePassword()
	•	🧬 Expression Trees + Source Gen → CreateGetter(), BuildPredicate()
	•	🌍 Environment-Ready Config → LoadEnv(), CurrentEnv(), MustBePresent()

Zero fluff. Every line earns its place. These are patterns I deploy to automate CAD systems, ERP workflows, and industrial-grade configurators in production.
